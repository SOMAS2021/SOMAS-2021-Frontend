    "The Tower is a vast monolith that is divided into floors and on each floor, there are Residents. There is a top floor called the Kitchen, and then a series of Floors, numbered from Floor 1 onwards, and downwards. No one has ever reported there not being a level below them.",
  description2:"Through the middle of The Tower runs an elevator platform. Once a day, the Platform visits each Floor in turn, starting from Floor 1 and descending downwards. The Platform carries food: nutritious and delicious food. The platform stops for a period of time at each floor, during which the Residents on that floor may eat as much as they like from the food available, but they may not save any.",
  description3:"All the Residents know is that on any one day there is not enough food to satiate (satisfy maximally) everyone, nor indeed enough food to satisfice (satisfy minimally) on any one day; however, there would be enough food over a period of time to satisfice everyone. If a Resident does not get enough food over a certain duration, she is eliminated, and immediately replaced by a new resident.",
  description4:"Every N days, the Residents are randomly re-assigned to a new Floor. They do not know when the re-assignment will happen, nor to which Floor they will be assigned. To begin with, no agent has any knowledge of any other Resident: Residents can communicate by “shouting” up or down one adjacent level, but otherwise there is no communication between them. The objective of the Residents: to “win”, individually, by maximising their individual “utility”, and to “survive”, collectively, by minimising the number of replacements.",
